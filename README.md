## What is Wild-Circus - International?

> "Wild Circus" is an international circus company (fictional). My mission is to design and realize the website of presentation of this company. "Wild Circus" occurring worldwide, the site must therefore be in English. To create this site, I will need to use HTML technologies, CSS and the online code editor [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).
